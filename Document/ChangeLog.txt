0.2, <TBD>

Enhance:

  * Add 'from' command to import symbols to the global namespace
  * Add DebugSymbols class to support IDebugSymbols interfaces, which were used to maintain the debug symbols, such as query the data structure.
  * Add DebugDataSpaces class to support IDebugDataSpaces interfaces, which were used to maintain the memory data spaces, such as access the physical memory.
  * Add DebugSystemObjects class to supprot IDebugSystemObjects interfaces, which were used to maintain the system objects, such as to query process id by PEB.
  * Add DebugAdvanced class to support IDebugAdvanced interfaces, which were used to do some system level helper functions, such as get the thread context.

Improvement;

  * Use 'char *' instead of 'std::string' as the function parameter type, to avoid boost::python delete some wrong pointer
